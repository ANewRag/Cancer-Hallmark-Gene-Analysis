# Cancer-Hallmark-Gene-Analysis

"Cancer hallmark genes‚Äù are associated with important steps that lead to the spread and development of cancer. In this project, we repeated an earlier study to see how these hallmark genes are linked to patient survival in different types of cancer. We used gene expression data and patient survival information from a large public database called The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). After preparing the data, we used statistical analysis tools to find which genes correlated with better or worse survival outcomes.
